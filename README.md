**Hi there, I'm Tara 👋**

🌱 Data & AI Enthusiast | Sales Professional | Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer

I'm passionate about using data to drive meaningful change, optimize processes, and solve complex problems. With over three years of experience in sales, account management, and data-driven decision-making, I've recently pivoted toward AI and data engineering to fuel my passion for innovation.

**🔧 Technical Skills**

-Programming Languages: Python (Machine Learning, Data Science)

-Data Tools: Pandas, Numpy, SQL, Jupyter Notebooks

-Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn

-Technologies: Salesforce, Azure, Oracle, Microsoft Office (Advanced Excel)

-Certifications: Caltech Certified Machine Learning (April 2024) Scientific Computing with Python (June 2024)

**💼 Professional Background**

Throughout my career, I've embraced roles across a variety of industries, gaining a diverse set of skills that I apply to my daily work life. Starting from the ground up in retail and restaurant positions while putting myself through school, I learned the value of adaptability, customer service, and time management. Afterward, I transitioned to an analyst role at an online university, where I leveraged data-driven insights to enhance operations before moving on to my current position as an account manager.

While I’m proud of the growth I’ve achieved in each role, I’ve found that my best work comes when I’m regularly challenging myself to learn new things and tackle different problems. I thrive on variety and enjoy switching things up to stay mentally stimulated and agile. Now, I’m ready for my next shift—one that will push me to expand my skills in data and AI while allowing me to continue bringing a fresh perspective to everything I do. 

**🔍 What I'm Working On**

I recently finished my AI ML Certification through Caltech, and am exploring the job market to try and land a role in that industry. Some of my recent projects include:

Lending Club Project: Built a deep learning model to predict loan defaults.

ML Song Clustering Algorithm: Analyzed song data from Rolling Stones albums to generate music recommendations.

Retail Sales Analysis: Provided actionable insights through sales data analysis.

**🚀 Goals**

-I’m aiming to fully transition into AI engineering and data analytics, with a long-term goal of becoming a Machine Learning Engineer and eventually working in an AI Ethics department.

-AI is advancing rapidly, with the potential to be incredibly beneficial, harmful, or anywhere in between. I’m committed to contributing positively to this growth, regardless of the role I’m in, and to being part of this exciting chapter in our history.
